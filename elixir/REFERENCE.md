# BluefinTecsEcr Elixir SDK Reference

Complete API reference for the BluefinTecsEcr Elixir SDK.


## BluefinTecsEcr

### Constructor

```elixir
sdk = BluefinTecsEcr.new(options)
```

Create a new SDK client. `options` is a struct value node — build one from a
native map with `BluefinTecsEcr.Helpers.deep/1`.

**Options:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apikey` | `String.t()` | API key for authentication. |
| `base` | `String.t()` | Base URL for API requests. |
| `prefix` | `String.t()` | URL prefix appended after base. |
| `suffix` | `String.t()` | URL suffix appended after path. |
| `headers` | `map()` | Custom headers for all requests. |
| `feature` | `map()` | Feature configuration. |
| `system` | `map()` | System overrides (e.g. custom fetch). |


### Constructors

#### `BluefinTecsEcr.test(testopts \\ nil, sdkopts \\ nil)`

Create a test client with mock features active. Both arguments may be `nil`.

```elixir
sdk = BluefinTecsEcr.test()
```


### Functions

#### `BluefinTecsEcr.ecr_api(client, entopts \\ nil)`

Create a `BluefinTecsEcr.Entity.EcrApi` handle.

#### `options_map(client) :: map()`

Return a deep copy of the current SDK options.

#### `get_utility(client) :: map()`

Return the SDK utility node.

#### `direct(client, fetchargs) :: map()`

Make a direct HTTP request to any API endpoint. Returns a result node with
`ok`, `status`, `headers`, and `data` (or `err` on failure). This escape
hatch never raises — branch on `Voxgig.Struct.getprop(result, "ok")`.

**fetchargs keys:**

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | `String.t()` | URL path with optional `{param}` placeholders. |
| `method` | `String.t()` | HTTP method (default: `"GET"`). |
| `params` | `map()` | Path parameter values. |
| `query` | `map()` | Query string parameters. |
| `headers` | `map()` | Request headers (merged with defaults). |
| `body` | `any()` | Request body (maps are JSON-serialized). |

#### `prepare(client, fetchargs) :: map()`

Prepare a fetch definition without sending. Returns the `fetchdef` and raises
on error.

Features are activated via the `feature` option:

```elixir
sdk = BluefinTecsEcr.new(BluefinTecsEcr.Helpers.deep(%{
  "feature" => %{
    "audit" => %{"active" => true},
    "clienttrack" => %{"active" => true},
    "idempotency" => %{"active" => true},
    "log" => %{"active" => true},
    "metrics" => %{"active" => true},

    "telemetry" => %{"active" => true},
    "test" => %{"active" => true},
    "timeout" => %{"active" => true},
  }
}))
```


### Configuring features

Each feature is inactive until switched on, and an SDK with no feature
configured does no feature work at all. Every option below keeps its default
unless you name it.

The array form of \`feature\` is significant: several features wrap the
transport, and the order you list them in is the order they nest.

#### Ordering

`ratelimit`, `retry`, `timeout` wrap the transport. Each
wraps whatever is already installed, so **activation order is nesting order**:
a feature activated later sits OUTSIDE one activated earlier, and sees the call
first.

That decides behaviour, not just sequence: a feature that short-circuits the
call, such as a cache serving a hit, stops every feature nested inside it from
ever seeing that call.

`audit`, `clienttrack`, `idempotency`, `log`, `metrics`, `paging`, `telemetry`, `test` attach to pipeline hooks
rather than the transport, so their order does not affect what they observe.

#### `audit`

Structured audit trail of operations.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `actor` | `'anonymous'` |
| `max` | `1000` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.audit.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `clienttrack`

Client identity and per-request correlation headers.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `clientVersion` | `'0.0.1'` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.clienttrack.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `idempotency`

Idempotency keys for safe retries of mutating operations.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `header` | `'Idempotency-Key'` |
| `methods` | `['POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE']` |
| `ops` | `['create', 'update', 'remove']` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.idempotency.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `log`

Structured request and response logging.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `true` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.log.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.

reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.metrics.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `paging`

Pagination signals for list operations.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.

reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.ratelimit.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Wraps the transport: its place in the activation order decides what it
  sees. See [Ordering](#ordering) above.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `retry`

Automatic retry of transient failures with exponential backoff.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `factor` | `2` |
| `maxDelay` | `2000` |

#### `test`

In-memory mock transport for testing without a live server.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |

also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.test.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.
