    // toolchain still targets, and the SDK's AsyncStream-based streaming
    // (EntityBase) fails to compile on macOS with "'AsyncStream' is only
    // available in macOS 10.15 or newer" - linux has no such floor, which
    // is why the generator's own linux runs never saw it. Found by the
    // secrets lane, the first lane to build a full generated swift SDK on
    // the macos CI leg.
